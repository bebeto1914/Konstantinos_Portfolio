# [Project 1: Java Coinsorter](https://github.com/bebeto1914/Java_Coinsorter)
* Created a coin denominations application that enables the user to check how many coins of a certain denomination can be exchanged given an input value.
* The application is written in Java and has an intuitive GUI.
* Part of series of Uni assignments.

# [Project 2: Python Data cleansing and analysis](https://github.com/bebeto1914/Python_Data_Cleansing_Analysis)
* Created a Data manipulation, visualisation and analysis tool. The application takes as input 3 large data sets in .csv format and translates them into .json format, creating the appropriate files respectively. Following the GUI of the application, the user can use the visualisation tools that are embedded, using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
* The data cleansing is achieved with using the Pandas API, of Python.
* Part of series of Uni assignments.
